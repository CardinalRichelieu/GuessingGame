# Guessing Game
This is a beginner text game written in Python 3.9 where the player bets that they
can guess the number that the house has chosen, from the numbers 1, 2, or 3.
In this version the player starts with $100 and can bet either 25 or 50. 
The game ends if they player goes bankrupt or decides to stop playing when
prompted.

# Getting Started
The code for the game can be found in the guessing.py file. This game was written with Python 3.9 in a Pycharm virtual environment. The Random module was the only imported module used for this game. 

# Project Status
Currently working on posting an issue regarding trying to filter out incorrect input from the player when they are asked to place a bet. So keep an eye out for that issue in the next week if you are interested in helping out.
